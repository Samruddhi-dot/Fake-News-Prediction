One of the people said that the details of the allegations, while unverified, were troubling enough that they left 21st Century Fox little choice but to force an end to Mr. Ailes\\u2019s reign as chairman and chief executive of Fox News, given the potential liability they presented to the company both legally and in terms of its own corporate culture. The people with knowledge of the state of discussions over Mr. Ailes\\u2019s exit agreement said both sides were working toward an accommodation that would recognize Mr. Ailes\\u2019s service to the company as the founder and leader of Fox News, which sits atop the cable news ratings and is a major profit engine for 21st Century Fox. The agreement could also include a provision for him to continue with Fox as a consultant. But given the personalities and complications involved, the situation was fluid enough that no accommodation had been reached by Wednesday night. Fox News did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the discussions or on the investigation, which is being conducted by the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison. Lawyers for Mr. Ailes did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Ailes has denied the allegations of sexual harassment and more than a dozen Fox News staff members, including some top stars, have publicly supported him. The people briefed on the investigation, who would not speak for attribution because of the sensitivity of the investigation, stressed that it was narrowly focused on the allegations against Mr. Ailes, and not the broader climate at the network. But Mr. Ailes\\u2019s departure will have much wider implications. Given Fox News\\u2019s place as a central hub for conservative opinion  \\u2014   not to mention as a primary outlet for the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump  \\u2014   the shape of its   operation goes beyond corporate intrigue at 21st Century Fox, and could have consequences for the national political dialogue. In the two weeks since Gretchen Carlson, a former Fox anchor, filed suit against Mr. Ailes, the Murdoch family, which runs 21st Century Fox, has made it clear that its decision to take the allegations seriously was in keeping with its desire to follow modern standards for office conduct, and that these needed to extend to Fox News, as well. The question in the   environment is to what extent the Murdochs decide to continue on with Mr. Ailes\\u2019s current management team. That, in turn, could determine the future approach and look of the network, which is the outlet of choice for   viewers seeking an alternative to the mainstream media. Speculation about who Mr. Ailes\\u2019s successor would be transfixed the media world on Wednesday, with focus on outsiders such as the CBS News president, David Rhodes, who had worked at Fox News for several years one of Mr. Ailes\\u2019s current lieutenants, like Bill Shine or Michael Clemente the New York Post chief executive Jesse Angelo or someone from conservative media like Christopher Ruddy, the founder and chief executive of Newsmax Media Inc. At least for the day, fears that some of Fox News\\u2019s   stars, like Bill O\\u2019Reilly, Sean Hannity and Greta Van Susteren, would exercise contract clauses to leave with Mr. Ailes\\u2019s loss of his chairmanship, appeared to abate. Network staff members were acutely focused on Megyn Kelly, who had hinted in recent months she wanted to leave the network. She was one of the women who told Paul, Weiss investigators that Mr. Ailes had acted improperly with her, one of the people briefed on the inquiry said Tuesday. Ms. Kelly maintained her silence on Wednesday. But as the end of Mr. Ailes\\u2019s chairmanship approached, it appeared to embolden other women to discuss their own experiences at the network. Several spoke with reporters on condition that they not be named. In interviews, several current and former Fox News employees said inappropriate comments about a woman\\u2019s appearance and her sex life were frequent in the newsroom. The newsroom has been on edge in the weeks since Ms. Carlson filed her suit, one person said. Everybody wants to talk about the drama but nobody wants to talk in the open, the person said. As of Wednesday evening, staff members had not received an email from 21st Century Fox, Fox News or Mr. Ailes informing them about the events that have transpired, the investigation or the future of the network. The swift pace of events at Fox News  \\u2014   only two weeks passed between Ms. Carlson\\u2019s filing of her lawsuit and the negotiations to end Mr. Ailes\\u2019s leadership  \\u2014   were especially surprising for a network that has made its name by embracing \\u201cpolitically incorrect\\u201d themes, something in keeping with the brash personalities of both Mr. Ailes and the 21st Century Fox patriarch, Rupert Murdoch. Female hosts in skirts, sitting behind translucent desks that can highlight their legs, have always been a network trademark. To completely move away from that ethos would be to fundamentally change the network. And 21st Century Fox\\u2019s leadership will have to be mindful of maintaining its special relationship with viewers that Mr. Ailes has so carefully cultivated, and which is central to the financial and ratings success of the network. Mr. Murdoch will ultimately determine that direction in close consultation  \\u2014   and perhaps even some deference  \\u2014   to the two sons he is grooming to succeed him, Lachlan and James Murdoch. The latter, at least, is known to have different politics from his father. So far, none of the three has made any public statement about the network, its future or, for that matter, Mr. Ailes.\",\n          \"Democrats in Montana have opposed a bill banning the use of foreign law in its state courts on the grounds that such legislation would target Muslims. [Senate Bill 97, introduced by Keith Regier ( ) bans the application of foreign law in Montana\\u2019s courts, with the debate particularly focused on Sharia Law, a form of Islamic law typically used in the Middle East.  Although the bill passed on party lines by   Democrats claimed it was designed to target Muslim communities. \\u201cI think it sends a dangerous message to minority groups both here living in our state and wanting to come visit our state, just merely on the fact that you may be different,\\u201d said Rep. Shane Morigeau,   while debating the bill. \\u201cI truly believe this law is repugnant. I believe this is not who we are as Montanans. \\u201d Meanwhile, Rep. Ellie Hill Smith ( ) proposed a failed amendment to the bill to include a ban on both Sharia Law and the Law of Moses, in order to \\u201cshow the state of Montana that it is not just about Islamic Law. \\u201d \\u201cThe courts have said that laws that single out certain religions violate the First Amendment,\\u201d Smith said, claiming that it was \\u201cpeppered with   bigotry. \\u201d Another Democrat, Rep. Laurie Bishop ( ) urged legislators \\u201cnot to forget the roots of this bill,\\u201d adding that \\u201cour children are watching. \\u201d Meanwhile, Rep. Brad Tschida ( ) said the bill was an attempt to push back against a \\u201cconstitution [that] is constantly under assault. \\u201d Bills specifically targeting Sharia Law have passed in states such as North Carolina, Alabama, Arizona, Kansas, Louisiana, South Dakota, and Tennessee. The bill will now be passed on to Gov. Steve Bullock (D) for signature or veto.

The company\\u2019s president has been forced to resign in disgrace after 60,000 Panasonic TVs abruptly ascended to heaven without warning. \\nWe\\u2019ll give you a minute to finish shaking your head. \\nThe scandal broke early last night when 60,000 of the company\\u2019s popular DX802-model flat-screen TVs from all over the world silently lifted off of the ground and, despite their owners yelling at them to stop and trying to drag them back down to Earth, floated away from the mortal realm and into the kingdom of heaven to reside with the immortal seraphim for all eternity. \\nYikes. Needless to say, Panasonic customers are not happy! Only a few minutes after the televisions began their skyward journey to the kingdom of God, Panasonic found themselves completely inundated with tweets like this: \\nWow. Panasonic definitely wishes it could rewind the clock on this one! Chances are, when you\\u2019re trying to stay competitive as one of the world\\u2019s foremost electronics companies, the last thing you want is for tens of thousands of your televisions to drift skyward into paradise. \\nWe\\u2019ve got to give credit where credit is due: At least Panasonic had the decency to admit that they let their customers down. The company has issued a public apology, and in a drastic move, the president of the company, Kazuhiro Tsuga, chose to resign in the wake of this scandal. Speaking at a press conference this morning, Tsuga issued the following statement: \\n\\u201cAfter much consideration, I have chosen to step down as the president of Panasonic Corp. If I could, I would travel to Heaven and retrieve each and every one of these televisions. I would kill any angel who tried to stop me from carrying these TVs out of paradise and returning them to our loyal Panasonic customers on Earth. Even if I saw God sitting on one of our missing DX802 flat-screens, I would shove the Lord off of the TV so that I could retrieve it for our customers. Unfortunately, I do not have the power to travel to Heaven, and so I am left with no choice but to resign my position.\\u201d \\nTsuga\\u2019s resignation is a nice gesture, but it doesn\\u2019t bring back a swarm of televisions from heaven. Panasonic\\u2019s reputation has been severely tarnished by the rapturing of their televisions. Whoever steps up to become Panasonic\\u2019s new president is going to have to do everything they can to prevent any of their products from ascending to heaven ever again.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# counting the number of missing values in the dataset\n","\n","news_dataset.isnull().sum()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":241},"id":"jX2g8O6eH20A","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736305457534,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":737,"user":{"displayName":"Samruddhi Magdum","userId":"05239853456881346904"}},"outputId":"12e25bda-5e0c-44ed-a8c9-aa1f601d5523"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["id          0\n","title      57\n","author    227\n","text        6\n","label       0\n","dtype: int64"],"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>id</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>title</th>\n","      <td>57</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>author</th>\n","      <td>227</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>label</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div><br><label><b>dtype:</b> int64</label>"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# replacing the null values with empty string\n","\n","news_dataset = news_dataset.fillna('')"],"metadata":{"id":"S8EG1762IS5Q"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#merging the author name and news title\n","\n","news_dataset['content'] = news_dataset['author']+' '+news_dataset['title']"],"metadata":{"id":"8r-eN3pKIyFd"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(news_dataset['content'])"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"AXmfqQIfKBK-","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736305470426,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":20,"user":{"displayName":"Samruddhi Magdum","userId":"05239853456881346904"}},"outputId":"0c9c22f2-a601-419c-e3c7-38500d7c64b1"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["0       Darrell Lucus House Dem Aide: We Didn’t Even S...\n","1       Daniel J.
