# Fake News Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to detect and predict fake news using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It covers data preprocessing, feature extraction, model implementation, evaluation, and deployment options. The goal is to build a reliable system for combating misinformation.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizing techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance.
- **Deployment**: Providing options to deploy the model as a web app or API for real-time predictions.

## Dataset
The project uses publicly available fake news datasets, which include labeled articles for training and testing purposes. Example datasets:
